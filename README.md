# CS499 Semester Project

This website is for a project from the CS499 - Network Analysis/Characterization course at
Northern Arizona University.

## Project Desciption

### High-level Description
The problem we are solving is creating a network of Let's Play channels on YouTube based on the number
of videos they post for games to be a channel recommender for the Let's Play channels of simliar gaming
content.

The problem that we are solving is important because the Let's Play community on YouTube has been growing
as more people watch others play video games and smaller channels could possibly use this network to do
collaborations so they can gain more subscribers or larger channels that are under parent channels can
reach out to smaller channels to give them a jumpstart on their channel.

## Data Used

### Description

We collected the data using the YouTube Data API to do search queries using fifty video games
that have at least 10,000 videos containing footage of the game. Videos that contain the words
_trailer_, _song_, _theme_, and _tutorial_ were excluded from our data becaue these videos do not
pertain to what videos we are trying to collect for our project.
